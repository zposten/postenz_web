# Mom's Omelets

My mom's omelets are famous where I come from, and for good reason.  It was difficult getting her to give me measurements that didn't consist of "pinches" and "splashes" of things, but eventually I got pretty close.

## Prep

### Bacon
- [ ] Cook bacon, save grease
- [ ] Break up into small pieces

### Potatoes
- [ ] Peel potatoes
- [ ] Dice into small cubes (or you know, rectangular prisms).
- [ ] Pour most of a bottle of pure vegetable oil into a large frying pan and heat on high until potatoes sizzle when placed in.
	- Oil should be hot enough so that the outside gets crispy while the inside does not.  The burner should be at least as high as 8/10.  
	- Be careful of splatter when pouring the potatoes into the hot oil.
- [ ] Let sit for two minutes (stir too early and the potatoes will turn to mush).
- [ ] Stir until potato cuboids are golden brown.
- [ ] Dump the potatoes in a large bowl lined with paper towel to soak up grease 

### Eggs
- [ ] 2 eggs/omelet
- [ ] Add a quarter cup of milk for every four eggs
- [ ] Add about a shake of each salt and pepper per egg for flavoring
- [ ] Whisk the mixture until it's a cohesive whole.


## Make It

- [ ] Coat the bottom of the pan in bacon oil by tipping the pan around
- [ ] Pour the eggs into the pan to fill the bottom in a quick fashion so part of it doesn't start to cook before the rest
- [ ] Let the egg solidify while filling any holes
- [ ] Add cheese over the entirety of the egg
- [ ] Add the potatoes, bacon and optionally the onion and sausage on half of the egg circle
- [ ] When the egg has some brown on the bottom, carefully flip the other half of egg over the ingredient half
	- It may be helpful to use two spatulas to do this.
