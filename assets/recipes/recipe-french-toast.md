## Make It

- [ ] Beat together everything, except for the bread...obviously.
- [ ] Heat a lightly oiled griddle or skillet over medium heat.
- [ ] Dunk each slice of break in egg concoction, soaking both sides.
- [ ] Cook the bread until both sides are golden.
	- Optionally, you could cover the bread while it's frying to cook the insides more.
	- This is most beneficial if the bread is very soggy after being removed from the egg mixture.
- [ ] Serve hot!
