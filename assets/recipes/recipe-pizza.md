# Johnny's Pizza
It's hard to believe that this guy can cook, but after you try his pizza, there is no longer any denying.

This recipe makes enough for a 16 inch pizza.  If you're trying to make a smaller 13 inch pizza, use about ⅔ of the dough.

## Preparation

#### Dough
- [ ] Combine all dough ingredients apart from the flour in a large mixing bowl.
- [ ] Stir in the flour 1 cup at a time
- [ ] Once 2.5 cups have been added, start to knead the dough with your hands.
- [ ] Dust the dough as needed with additional flour as it becomes sticky.
- [ ] Knead the dough until it becomes "springy" and "just a tad sticky".
- [ ] Cover the mixing bowl to avoid debris before letting it sit for 30 minutes to rise.


#### Sauce
- [ ] Combine all sauce ingredients in a small mixing bowl
    - Be careful on how much of the red pepper you add, it can get quite spicy.


## Make It
- [ ] Cook and drain the Italian sausage and the beef and pork if you so choose to include them.
    - The Italian sausage cooks a lot like hamburger
- [ ] Cover the pizza stone with wax paper
    - The wax paper is useful so that the dough is not pressed into the pizza stone, making removing it later difficult.
- [ ] Press the dough into a circle to cover the stone
- [ ] Flip the dough over directly onto the stone, thereby removing the wax paper.
- [ ] Pinch/roll over the outer edge of the dough to form a crust
- [ ] Spread the sauce over the dough with a spatula, it should be a pretty thin layer.
- [ ] Add toppings
- [ ] Add Cheese
- [ ] Insert the pizza and stone into the oven
- [ ] Bake at 375 to 425 for 15-25 min, or until cheese has browned some and crust has become crispy.


# DO NOT ATTEMPT TO GRILL THIS PIZZA
<sup>At least one pizza stone has been tragically lost to this seemingly great idea already.</sup>
