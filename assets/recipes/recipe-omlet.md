# Mom's Omelets

My mom's omelets are famous where I come from, and for good reason.  It was difficult getting her to give me measurements that didn't consist of "pinches" and "splashes" of things, but eventually I got pretty close.

## Ingredients

- 1 lb bacon
- 2 eggs per omelet
- Shredded cheddar cheese
- 2 small potatoes per omelet
- Salt and pepper
- Yellow onion (optional)

## Preparation

### Bacon
1. Cook bacon, save grease
1. Break up into small pieces

### Potatoes
1. Peel potatoes
1. Dice into small cubes (or you know, rectangular prisms).
1. Pour most of a bottle of pure vegetable oil into a large frying pan and heat until potatoes sizzle when placed in.
1. Let sit for five minutes (stir too early and the potatoes will turn to mush).
1. Stir until potato cuboids are golden brown.
1. Dump the potatoes in a large bowl lined with paper towel

### Eggs
1. 2 eggs/omelet
1. Add a quarter cup of milk for every five eggs
1. Add about a shake of each salt and pepper per egg for flavoring


## Cooking

- [ ] Coat the bottom of the pan in bacon oil by tipping the pan around
- [ ] Pour the eggs into the pan to fill the bottom in a quick fashion so part of it doesn't start to cook before the rest
- [ ] Let the egg solidify while willing any holes
- [ ] Add cheese over the entirety of the egg
- [ ] Add the potatoes, bacon and optionally the onion on half of the egg circle
- [ ] Carefully flip the other half of egg over the ingredient half
