## Ingredients

| Ingredient             | Amount                |
|------------------------|--------------------   |
| Potatoes               | 5 lbs                 |
| Butter                 | 8 - 12 tbsp, softened |
| Cream Cheese           | 8 oz, softened        |
| Half and Half          | Â½ cup                 |
| Lawry's Seasoned Salt  | 1 tsp                 |
| Black Pepper           | 1 tsp                 |



## Make It 

- [ ] Peel the potatoes.  After peeling, rinse them under cold water
- [ ] Chop the potatoes into quarters so that they cook more quickly and evenly
- [ ] Boil a large pot of water and toss in the potatoes.  Let them cook for about 30 minutes.  
	- When they're cooked through, a fork should slide easily into the potatoes with no resistance.  They should almost -- but not totally -- fall apart.  If the fork meets any resistance, that means lumpy potatoes!
- [ ] Drain the potatoes and put them back into the pot on the stove
- [ ] Turn the burner on low and begin to mash the potatoes with, you guessed it, a potato masher.  
	- Mashing the potatoes before adding the other ingredients allows all of the steam to escape so that the final product won't be watery
	- Using the sharp blades of an electric mixer can break down the starch in the potatoes and make the final product gummy.  That's why a hand masher is recommended.
- [ ] Turn off the stove
- [ ] Add the butter, cream cheese, and half & half
	- A note on the cream cheese: I was skeptical too.  But it just adds such a nice flavor to the mashed potatoes, and you'll never know it was there.
- [ ] Mash it again, until everything is combined nicely
- [ ] Add the Lawry's and the pepper, and mash again!
