For those of you who don't know me, my name is Zach. For those of you who do know me, my name is still Zach.  In May of 2016, I graduated from [MSOE][msoe] with high honors with a Bachelors of Science in Software Engineering, and a minor in Mathematics.  My degree is in Software Engineering, but at my core I am a problem solver. I love puzzles in all forms, and an constantly looking for new challenges.

Through my four years at MSOE I touched on a wide range of technologies including Java, web apps, databases, C#, python, network protocols, [beaglebone][bone], both mobile platforms, and many others. However, my particular interests lie in application and user interface development. I enjoy working on the pieces of a system that non-programmers use to do their work, and interacting with these people in order to find out more about how they use the system and how I can improve it for them. User interfaces are a particular interest of mine because I believe that it combines my programming and graphic design abilities in a very unique way.
