        For those of you who don't know me, my name is Zach.  For those of you who do know me, my name is still Zach.
        I am currently a senior at MSOE, and will be graduating in May of 2016.  My degree will be in Software Engineering,
        but at my core I am a problem solver.  I love puzzles in all forms, and an constantly looking for new challenges.

        Through my four years at MSOE I have touched on a wide range of technologies including Java, web apps, databases,
        C#, python, network protocols, beaglebone, both mobile platforms, and many others.  However, my particular interests
        lie in application and user interface development.  I enjoy working on the pieces of a system that non-programmers
        use to do their work, and interacting with these people in order to find out more about how they use the system
        and how I can improve it for them.  User interfaces are a particular interest of mine because I believe that it
        combines my skills of programming and graphic design in a very unique way.

        information from this online document.

        Most recently, I have put a great deal of time into improving my web development skills, through creating this website.
        I created everything you see here using a variety of frameworks and libraries.  First and foremost, this site is
        built using Google's Angular framework.  Angular is such a vast framework that I feel as though I have still only
        scratched the surface, however I have incorporated Angular templates, directives, scopes, filters, controllers,
        and most notibly UI routing.  Additionally, I'm using Bootstrap for style, Showdown for markdown parsing,
        Photoswipe for displaying photographs, and Compass for cleaner and more modular CSS.  You may be able to see the
        new things I've been toying with by viewing the <a href="http://poste.nz/beta">beta version</a> of my site, or
        perusing <a href="https://github.com/zposten/postenz_web">the source on GitHub</a>
